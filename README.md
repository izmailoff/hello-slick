This is a template for [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted).

I have updated original code to latest Scala, SBT, Slick, etc as of Aug 15 2019. Removed SBT plugins only and changed deprecated code to new Slick API.

Original template can be found here: https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=slick&project=hello-slick-3.1 or here:
https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-hello-slick/tree/slick-3.1.

You don't have to install anything except for JDK8. Check out the code and run `sbt` or `sbt.bat` to compile and run the project.

Example commands:

`./sbt run`

`./sbt test`
